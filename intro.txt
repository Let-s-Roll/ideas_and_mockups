🛼 Let's Roll: New Features Handover Document1. Executive SummaryThis document outlines two major feature expansions for the "Let's Roll" app: International Events and the Learning Hub.The goal is to transition the app from a purely local social tool into a global lifestyle platform that supports skate travel and skill development.2. Feature A: International Events System ("Global Gatherings")ProblemCurrent event notifications are limited to a 25km radius. Major festivals (e.g., "Paris Skate Jam") are invisible to international users who might travel for them. Additionally, automated content ingestion ("Lateral Admin") threatens to flood the feed with too much local noise.The Solution: "Spotlight Carousel" UIInstead of complex tabs or filters, we separate content by Axis:Horizontal Axis (Top): "The World Tour" Carousel. Exclusively for events flagged as International. High-impact, poster-style cards.Vertical Axis (Bottom): "Local Scene". The standard feed sorted by distance/time for daily utility.Technical RequirementsThe "International" Flag: A boolean property (isInternational) on the Event object.Permissions: Only Admins and Pro Users can set this flag.Notifications: Toggling this flag triggers a Global Push Notification (bypassing the 25km limit).Sorting Logic: The main feed must prioritize local events (within 50km) while the carousel highlights global events, ensuring automated content doesn't bury major festivals.3. Feature B: The Learning Hub ("Pro Tutorials")ProblemPro skaters currently post educational clips into the main social feed, where they get lost. Users have no dedicated space to find "How-to" content.The Solution: Dedicated Learning TabA new main navigation tab ("Learn") specifically for educational content.Technical Requirements"Is Tutorial" Toggle: A new boolean switch in the "Create Post" flow.Style Tagging: If isTutorial is true, the user MUST select a SkateStyle (re-using the existing Enum from Session Tracking, e.g., Roller Dance, Aggressive, Speed).Video Limits: Tutorials allow for longer video uploads (e.g., up to 10 mins).Filtering: The Learning Hub must support filtering by SkateStyle.4. Design Reference (Mockup)A high-fidelity HTML/CSS mockup has been created to demonstrate:The "Spotlight" Interaction: Horizontal scrolling for global events vs. vertical scrolling for local lists.The "Pro" Create Flow: UI for the new toggles (Yellow for International, Indigo for Tutorials).Visual Badges: Color-coded tags for Skate Styles in the Learning Hub.Refer to lets_roll_mockup.html for the interactive prototype.
